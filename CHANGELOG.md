# Changelog

All notable changes to Gristle are documented here. This file is intended for consuming applications to track what's new, what changed, and what might break.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`gristle` CLI** — `ingest`, `overview`, `explore`, `query`, `doctor`, and
  `serve` subcommands (bare `gristle` still starts the MCP server).
- **Engine rehydration** — tools work against previously-ingested repos after a
  server restart (rebuilt from the FalkorDB graph) instead of re-ingesting.
- **`/ready` endpoint** — pings FalkorDB; `/health` is now liveness-only.
- **Parsers** — TS/JS decorator extraction, NestJS controller routes, tsconfig
  `paths`/`baseUrl` import resolution, and SQLAlchemy/Django/TypeORM model
  detection (Model/ModelField/relation nodes).
- **Code → data edges** — new `USES_MODEL` edge (Function → Model, with a
  read/write `access` property) links code that queries a model to it. Covers
  method-chain access (Django/SQLAlchemy/Prisma, e.g. `User.objects.filter()`)
  **and** model/table passed as a call argument — Drizzle `db.insert(chat)` /
  `db.select().from(chat)` and SQLAlchemy `session.query(User)` / `select(User)`.
  Precise by design: an edge requires a read/write verb in the call's method name
  (never from an argument), so incidental name reuse doesn't create false edges.
- **Inline route handlers** — Express/Hono routes whose handler is an inline
  arrow/function (`app.get('/x', (c) => …)`) now synthesize an entry-point
  Function node, so the route gets a `HANDLES` edge and route→handler→callee/
  model tracing works (previously the callback was anonymous and unlinked).
  On a real Hono repo: routes with a handler went from ~0.5% to 93.8%.
- **Packaging** — tag-triggered PyPI + GHCR release workflow, single-source
  version (hatch dynamic), and `examples/sample-app`.

### Changed
- Relationship writes are label-scoped so FalkorDB uses the id index instead of
  a full-scan Cartesian product (~2× faster ingest on large repos).
- GitHub ingests keep the clone under `GRISTLE_REPO_STORAGE_PATH` so source
  loading works (removed by `gristle_drop`).

### Fixed
- Ingest no longer aborts on a null `RELATED_TO` relation property; enrichment
  phases (config/schema/docs) are isolated so one failure degrades gracefully.
- MCP tools return a structured `{"error": ...}` (with an actionable message
  when FalkorDB is unreachable) instead of leaking raw exceptions.
- Incremental watch path passed the wrong type to call resolution
  (`AttributeError`); now uses a `BatchCollector`.
- `MERGE` relationship writes mis-bound per-row properties (a property map in a
  MERGE pattern is match criteria in FalkorDB); now applied with `SET`. Affected
  `RELATED_TO` and any merged edge with properties.
- Drizzle foreign keys/relations on multi-line column chains were dropped
  (line-based parsing detached `.references()`); now split on top-level commas
  (e.g. ai-chatbot: 0 → 6 model relations).
- `gristle_impact` double-counted transitive callers (one row per path); now
  one row per node (min depth).
- `detect_unauthenticated_routes` flagged routes that authenticate via an inline
  `auth()` call (e.g. Next.js); now honors a `calls_auth` signal + auth callees.
- Python `is_exported` only fired on `__all__`, leaving `gristle_public_api` and
  coverage empty for most repos; now public module-level names are exported.
